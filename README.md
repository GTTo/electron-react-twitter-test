# Getting Started 

This project was a test app created for apply for an Axosoft React developer position.

## Setup

It's needed to configure a Twitter BEARER TOKEN for getting access to twitter API.\
You have to set a BEARER_TOKEN environment variable in this way `BEARER_TOKEN='YOUR-TOKEN'` 

Check your OS documentation in order to set env variables.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Opens the app and let you tests it

### `yarn react-test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles `electron-react` in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
